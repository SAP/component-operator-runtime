  A resource generator for kustomizations
---

This generator allows to generate the manifests of the component's resources from a given kustomization.
As a special case, one or more simple Kubernetes manifests (without a `kustomization.yaml`) are supported as well.
In addition, all (or selected; see below) files in the kustomization directory can be templatized in a helm'ish way.
That means, they will be considered as a common template group (where all templates are associated with each other),
and the well-known template function set that is available in Helm can be used; that is, all the [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig) functions, plus functions like `include`, `tpl`, `lookup`, plus further functions are supported:

Notes:
- in case a function is provided by sprig and by us, our implementation is used
- all functions (unless otherwise stated) make the using template fail in case of errors
- as for the lookup functions, the target client points to the deployment target, the local client points to the cluster where the executing controller is running.

In the generation step, first, all the go templates will be rendered, and the result of this pre-step will be passed to kustomize.

A kustomize generator can be instantiated by calling the following constructor:

```go
package kustomize

func NewKustomizeGenerator(
  fsys fs.FS,
  kustomizationPath string,
  clnt client.Client,
  options KustomizeGeneratorOptions
) (*KustomizeGenerator, error) {
```

Here:
- `fsys` must be an implementation of `fs.FS`, such as `embed.FS`; or it can be passed as nil; then, all file operations will be executed on the current OS filesystem.
- `kustomizationPath` is the directory containing the (potentially templatized) kustomatization; if `fsys` was provided, this has to be a relative path; otherwise, it will be interpreted with respect to the OS filesystem (as an absolute path, or relative to the current working directory of the controller).
- `clnt` should be a client for the local cluster (i.e. the cluster where the component object exists).
- `options` allows to tweak the generator:
  ```go
  package kustomize
  
  type KustomizeGeneratorOptions struct {
    // If defined, only files with that suffix will be subject to templating.
    TemplateSuffix *string
    // If defined, the given left delimiter will be used to parse go templates;
    // otherwise, defaults to '{{'
    LeftTemplateDelimiter *string
    // If defined, the given right delimiter will be used to parse go templates;
    // otherwise, defaults to '}}'
    RightTemplateDelimiter *string
  }
  ```

  The generator options can be overridden on source level by creating a file `.component-config.yaml` in the specified `kustomizationPath`; the file can contain JSON or YAML, compatible with the  `KustomizeGeneratorOptions` struct.

As of now, the specified kustomization must not reference files or paths outside `kustomizationPath`. Remote references are generally not supported.
By default, all `.yaml` or `.yml` files in `kustomizationPath`, and its subdirectories, are subject to templating, and are considered if a `kustomization.yaml`
is auto-generated. It is possible to exclude certain files by creating a file `.component-ignore` in `kustomizationPath`; this `.component-ignore` file uses
the common `.gitignore syntax`.
